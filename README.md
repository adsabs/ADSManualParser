# ADSManualParser
Simple repo for setting up a data import directory for CSG / Curators.  Uses the new Ingest Data Model along with select functionality from adsabs-pyingest to generate Classic tagged files.


## Usage

`run.py` provides a basic all-in-one interface to the tools, but the modules
in adsmanparse can be called from custom scripts if desired.
